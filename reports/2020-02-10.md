### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

* *Communication*
* *We are still laying down the base logic of our game and it often demands refactoring and reorganization*
* *To keep everybody in the loop of the logic is very hard often when a big chunk of work is done, we have difficulties to make sure everybody understands it and is able to work with it*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report
